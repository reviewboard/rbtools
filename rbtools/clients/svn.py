        These will be used to generate the diffs to upload to Review Board (or
        print). The diff for review will include the changes in (base, tip].

        If a single revision is passed in, this will return the parent of that
        revision for 'base' and the passed-in revision for 'tip'.

        checked-out revision for 'base' and a special string indicating the
