        SCMTool-specific overrides of this method are expected to deal with
        such syntaxes.

        This will return a dictionary with the following keys:
            'base':        A revision to use as the base of the resulting diff.
            'tip':         A revision to use as the tip of the resulting diff.

        These will be used to generate the diffs to upload to Review Board (or
        print). The diff for review will include the changes in (base, tip].

        If a single revision is passed in, this will return the parent of that
        revision for 'base' and the passed-in revision for 'tip'.

        If zero revisions are passed in, this will return the most recently
        checked-out revision for 'base' and a special string indicating the
        working copy for 'tip'.

        The SVN SCMClient never fills in the 'parent_base' key. Users who are
        using other patch-stack tools who want to use parent diffs with SVN
        will have to generate their diffs by hand.
