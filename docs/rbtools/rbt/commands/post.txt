:command:`rbt post` simplifies both creating and updating review requests.
It can look at your source directory, generate a diff, and upload it to a new
or existing review request on an associated Review Board server. This saves a
lot of time over the web UI, and for some types of code repositories (such as
Perforce), it's actually required in order to produce a compatible diff.

Usage::

   $ rbt post [options] [changenum | [<file> ...]]


Posting and Updating Review Requests
====================================

Depending on the repository type, :command:`rbt post` will either require
a changeset number, or it will rely on the changes in the current source
tree. The end result is that :command:`rbt post` will build a diff and
post it to a Review Board server. The diff and any additional review
request information will be saved on the server as a draft, which can then
be published.

After posting a new review request or updating an existing one,
:command:`rbt post` will display the URL of the review request. If the
:option:`-o` parameter is passed, the default web browser will be opened
to that URL.

The following subsections will explain how :command:`rbt post` is used
with different repository types.


Perforce
--------

Posting Changesets
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Perforce has a concept of changesets, which are server-stored descriptions of
a change along with an ID number and associated files. For Perforce, Review
Board stores changeset numbers of a posted change and can use these to
associate particular changes with review requests.

To post a review request for a specific change, or to update an existing
review request for that change, type::

    $ rbt post CHANGENUM

Where ``CHANGENUM`` is the changeset number in Perforce.

The diff will be generated and uploaded to Review Board, and the review
request information will be updated based on the changeset description.

:command:`rbt post` must be used if you're using Perforce with
Review Board, as the diff generated by :command:`p4 diff` doesn't provide
the information necessary to properly display a side-by-side diff.


Posting Paths
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

There are cases where you may want to post individual paths containing files
instead of changesets. Take the following cases, for example:

* You have code or other files that must be checked in before they're
  reviewed and have undergone multiple changes.
* You're working in a side branch for a while, possibly with other people,
  and need to review the code before it's integrated into the main branch.
* You want to post a really old, previously abandoned change for review
  that previously went unreviewed.

To post with a path, :command:`rbt post` should be run with a standard
Perforce depot path as a parameter, which may contain revision information.
The following paths are supported:


**Uploading a file as a "new" file**::

   //path/to/file

**Uploading all files in a directory as "new" files**::

   //path/to/dir/...

**Uploading a file from a revision as a "new" file (not as common)**::

   //path/to/file/[@#]rev

**Uploading a diff of a file between two revisions**::

   //path/to/file[@#]rev,[@#]rev

**Uploading a diff of all files between two revisions in a directory**::

   //path/to/dir/...[#@]rev,[#@]rev


CVS and Subversion
------------------

CVS and Subversion don't have a concept of changesets, so instead the
working copy's uncommitted changes are posted for review. To post a
review request with all uncommitted files in a tree, simply run::

    $ rbt post

This will create a new review request and post the diff of the uncommitted
changes. If you  want to update an existing review request with new changes
instead, use the :option:`-r` parameter. For example, to update
review request #42, type::

    $ rbt post -r 42

If you need to post specific files, leaving other uncommitted files out of
the review request, you can include them on the command line, like so::

    $ rbt post src/foo.c data/bar.png


.. _DVCS:

Distributed Version Control Systems
-----------------------------------

When using a distributed version control system, such as Git or Mercurial,
:command:`rbt post` will by default post the diff between the current
branch and the ``master`` branch. To post a new review request with the
diff between the current branches commit, and the master branch, simply run::

   $ rbt post

If you'd like to update an existing review request with new changes instead,
use the :option:`-r` parameter. For example, to update review request #42,
type::

   $ rbt post -r 42

Additionally, :command:`rbt post` can generate a summary and description for
your review request based on the commit messages from the involved commits.
This is accomplished using the :option:`-g` parameter. To post a new review
request with a generated summary and description, simply run::

   $ rbt post -g

In the case where you are working on code based on a branch that isn't
available to the repository Review Board has configured, you'll want to take
advantage of :command:`rbt post`'s parent diff support.

.. index:: parent diffs

A parent diff is a diff between some known upstream revision that Review Board
has access to and the parent of your branch. It's used to provide a working
baseline for your branch's diff.

For example, in the case of Git, you may be working on the ``topicB`` branch,
which has an ancestry that looks like::

   o master
    \
     o---o topicA
          \
           o---o topicB

If you want to upload a diff of everything between ``topicA`` and ``topicB``,
you would need to tell :command:`rbt post` to also generate a parent diff
between ``master`` and ``topicA``.

This is done by using the :option:`--parent` parameter with the branch name.
For example, in this case you would simply do::

    $ rbt post --parent=topicA

That would generate a parent diff between ``master`` and ``topicA``, and
a normal diff of your changes between ``topicA`` and ``topicB``. The changes
in the parent diff won't appear as changed lines in the diff viewer, meaning
that users will only see changes made between ``topicB`` and ``topicA``.


Tracking Branches
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When using Git, :command:`rbt post` makes the assumption that the closest
upstream branch for the diff will be ``origin/master``. This may be wrong if
you are working on a feature branch or have a remote named something other than
``origin``.

In this case, you will want to use the :option:`--tracking-branch` option,
which specifies the remote branch name. For example::

    $ rbt post --tracking-branch=upstream/master


ClearCase
---------

:command:`rbt post` provides basic support for posting ClearCase reviews.
If you want to post a review of all currently checked out files in your view
simply run::

     rbt post

If you collect changesets, for example, using ClearCase/ClearQuest
integration, you can pass the changeset using :option:`--revision-range`.
Repository will be determined based on your current VOB's UUID or name::

    $ rbt post --revision-range="/vobs/proj/file.c@@/main/0:/vobs/proj/file.c@@/main/1"

Another way for post-commit review is send changes developed on branch by
:option:`--tracking` option::

    $ rbt post --tracking my_dev_branch

.. note::

   :command:`rbt post` trying match reviewboard's repository based on
   VOB's UUID. In case of problems Your VOB's name will be used.
   Remember. You can always overwrite this behavior using
   :file:`.reviewboardrc `file or passing :option:`--repository-url`.


.. index:: post-commit review
.. _posting-committed-code:

Posting Committed Code
======================

By default, :command:`rbt post` assumes that you're posting uncommitted
code. This is called a :term:`pre-commit review`. However, it's sometimes
useful to post code that has already been committed to a repository, such
as in an experimental branch. This is a :term:`post-commit review`.

In order to do this, you can use the :option:`--revision-range` parameter,
which will generate a diff based on a range of committed revisions.
This allows a single review request to show a diff representing the entire
history of a branch, if desired.

Usage is easy. Simply type::

    $ rbt post --revision-range=STARTREV:STOPREV

Where ``STARTREV`` is the beginning revision in the range, and
``STOPREV`` is the ending revision, inclusive. If you only need to post
a single revision, you can type::

    $ rbt post --revision-range=REVISION


.. _posting-existing-diffs:

Posting Existing Diffs
======================

:command:`rbt post` will generate diffs automatically based on the
repository type, but if you need to post a pre-existing diff, you can
use the :option:`--diff-filename` parameter to specify the path to
the diff file.

For example::

    $ rbt post --diff-filename=mycode.diff

You can also use the special value of ``-`` to pipe a diff into STDIN::

    $ cat mycode.diff | rbt post --diff-filename=-

Using STDIN will require either a valid cookie, or the :option:`--username`
and :option:`--password` options.


.. _automating-rbt-post:

Automating rbt post
===================

It's possible to automate :command:`rbt post` on a user's behalf. This can
be useful from a repository's :term:`post-commit hook` to automatically
create or update a review request. This works through a combination of a
special Review Board user and the :option:`--submit-as` option.

To set this up, first register a new user. This user will be specific to
your script, and will have special permissions, so make sure the password
is protected. You'll then want to grant the
:ref:`can-submit-as-user-permission` and
:ref:`can-edit-review-request-permission` to the user. This will give this
user to the ability to modify a review request as another user.

You can then invoke :command:`rbt post` by doing the following::

    $ rbt post --username=SPECIAL_USER --password=PASSWORD --submit-as=ANOTHER_USER

Of course, you can pass any other values as you see fit.

This will log in as ``SPECIAL_USER`` and perform operations as
``ANOTHER_USER``.

You can set the default for :option:`--submit-as` by setting ``SUBMIT_AS``
in :file:`.reviewboardrc`.
