.. _rbt-diff:
.. program:: rbt diff

====
diff
====

:command:`rbt diff` is similar to :command:`rbt post`, but will only
print the diff to standard out instead of creating a review request
for it.

Usage::

   $ rbt diff [options] [changenum | [<file> ...]]


Default Options
===============

A number of options to :command:`rbt diff` can be set by default
in :file:`.reviewboardrc`. These can go either in the repository's
or the user's :file:`.reviewboardrc`.

The options include:

* ``DEBUG`` (:option:`-d`)
* ``REVIEWBOARD_URL`` (:option:`--server`)
* ``USERNAME`` (:option:`--username`)
* ``PASSWORD`` (:option:`--password`)


Options
=======

.. cmdoption:: -d, --debug

   Display debug output.

   The default can be set in ``DEBUG`` in :file:`.reviewboardrc`.

.. cmdoption:: --server

   Specify a different Review Board server to use.

   The default can be set in ``REVIEWBOARD_URL`` in :file:`.reviewboardrc`.

.. cmdoption:: --revision-range

   Generate the diff for review based on given revision range.

.. cmdoption:: --parent

   The parent branch this diff should be against (only available if your
   repository supports parent diffs).

.. cmdoption:: --tracking-branch

   Tracking branch from which your branch is derived (Git only, defaults to
   origin/master)

.. cmdoption:: --svn-changelist

   Generate the diff for review based on a local SVN changelist.

   The url for a repository for creating a diff outside of a working copy
   (currently only supported by Subversion with :option:`--revision-range` or
   :option:`--diff-filename` and ClearCase with relative paths outside the
   view). For Git, this specifies the origin url of the current repository,
   overriding the origin url supplied by the Git client.
